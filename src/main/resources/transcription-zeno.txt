At first, all you can see is a thin white line stretching as far as your eyes can see. Then the line starts to rise. You squint, thinking, maybe it's a trick of the light. But it's not the horizon at all. It's a wave, a 30-foot wall of water. And it's racing straight toward you. What would you do? Listen to Against the Odds, Tsunami in Thailand, wherever you get your podcasts. And now, to mark the end of his 27 memorable years presenting In Our Time, we have Melvin Bragg to introduce the next in our series of his most cherished episodes. If the title In Our Time works at all, it's to describe this long period on earth in which we humans have tried to make sense of and enjoy the world around us. This is our time. Who would have thought that Zeno, a Greek philosopher two and a half thousand years ago, even before Socrates, was devising thought experiments that would still be inspiring cutting-edge scientists today? That's why we were discussing paradoxes, live at 9am back in 2016, and the audiences loved it. Hello, the ancient Greek thinker Zeno of Illyria flourished in the 5th century BC. His great innovation in philosophy was the paradox, a tool to highlight the unexpected consequences of common-sense ideas, to question assumptions and provoke new theories. For example, according to Zeno's paradoxes, motion is not possible. An arrow in flight does not move. The fastest runner in Homer, Achilles, could never catch up with a tortoise in a race if he gave it a head start. Philosophers from Aristotle to Bertrand Russell have tried to refute his ideas or explain them with varying success. Innovations in mathematics with Newton and Leibniz went some way to demonstrate flaws in Zeno's arguments, but the questions he raised two and a half thousand years ago about time and space are as relevant as ever and have re-emerged in quantum physics. With me to discuss the paradoxes of Zeno are Marcus Ussotoi, Professor of Mathematics and Simonia Professor for the Public Understanding of Science at the University of Oxford, Barbara Sattler, Lecturer in Philosophy at the University of St Andrews, and James Warren, Reader in Ancient Philosophy at the University of Cambridge. James Warren, what do we know about Zeno? Not a huge amount, unfortunately, so we know roughly when he was living and working. He's living, as you said, in the middle of the fifth century BC. He came from Elea, a town on the west coast of southern Italy, and we know that he traveled a lot in Greece, as people of that sort of class did, and he wrote a work, maybe just one work, which included these paradoxes, of which we know about, it depends how you count them, perhaps seven, eight, some to do with motion, some to do with plurality. What we can do is put him into some kind of context, intellectual context, that is. So for around... Let's just go into Elea for a moment or two. Is this a village, is it a town, is it known as an intellectual center, what's going on? It's a city, in the Greek sense of a city, it's a polis, it's an independent city-state that was founded by Greeks from the Greek mainland at some point. It seems to have been quite an intellectual center, in particular because I think one of the most important people in Zeno's intellectual life was, again, an Eliatic, was someone from the same city. This was a character called Parmenides, and Parmenides wrote a very peculiar poem in hexameter verse in the style of Homer, and Parmenides attempted to set out to prove that there was only one thing and that it was changeless and motionless and perfect and so on. When he said there was only one thing, I mean, the world was only one thing. There is just one thing, yes. So whatever else you think there is, if it's not this one thing, that isn't actually there. And he was Zeno's tutor, friend? Friend, tutor, something like that. It's not a formal relationship, but Plato writes a dialogue in which the two of them come to Athens and Zeno is cast as a defender of Parmenides. So that's one way to think of these paradoxes as an attempt to undercut possible objections to Parmenides' curious thesis on the basis of common sense assumptions that, well, there are many things and clearly things do move. You said quite casually he wandered over the place of the Greek as people did. What did he wander for? Where did he go to? How did he look after himself? Well, these aren't people who really have to work for a living. So we're talking about aristocrats? Yes. Well, well enough off people. That's right. And they would travel around and they would often, I think, the way in which these ideas were circulated were partly through written books. And Zeno complains that someone's made a pirated copy of his work, so he doesn't know how many of them there are in circulation, which is, I think, a joke on not even Zeno knows how many books there are. And they traveled to the great festivals like the Athenian Panathinaia Festival, and they would give demonstrations and public recitations and meet people there. And so what was, what were, he'd got his teacher, Parmenides, what learning was coming to him through Parmenides and in the context of the place that time, briefly, what was he reading that influenced him? Well, what Parmenides is reacting to is a is a tradition of cosmological thinking, which had been going on for perhaps up to 100 years by now, of people who were attempting to explain the world and how the world worked and functioned, often in terms of identifying some basic principle or element out of which the world was constructed. And like the world was constructed from water from water or air or something else, and describing the various transformations that that element or elements undergo in order to produce the varied and differentiated world that we see around us. And they're relying therefore on there being a plurality of things and there being things that change in our emotion in order to account for the way the world works. So natural philosophers are people believe that the world is changing, there are many things in it which are various and unmoving and changing. Yes, and that's what Parmenides sets out to show is grossly mistaken. Barbara Sattler, what is a paradox in philosophy? If we just look at the word that comes from the Greek, then that means it's against para, common expectations or common beliefs, doxa, right? So that's a paradox against what people normally would assume, what is strange, what is shocking, and therefore what needs explanation. So that's just the meaning of the word. In a philosophical context by a paradox we normally understand that we derive a problematic conclusion from sound premises. So it seems we have good starting points and we do right reasoning and yet we get to a conclusion that's untenable. And why is it untenable? Well, either because it's inconsistent in itself, it leads to a contradiction, or it contradicts other beliefs, opinions that we hold. Can you give us a simple paradox? It needn't be one of Zeno's just to get the hang of it. All right, so one paradox that's quite famous is the bald man paradox. So we all would agree that if somebody has no hair then this person is bald, if this person has one hair we would still call this person bald, two hair probably still bald, three and so on, but one hair doesn't seem to make a difference, but yet if this person has 10,000 hair it seems it's not this person is not bald any longer. So where does that stop? Is it that from 100 hair onwards we say oh this person is not bald but 99 hair is still bald? That doesn't seem to be right. Why not? Because it seems that with baldness it's not a concept or notion where we can give a clear quantitative determination. We can't say so and so many hairs quantify as not being bald and so and so many hairs quantify as being bald. But has common sense a place in this? Yeah, this uses common sense that we all agree on certain ideas of baldness and we all have a problem of saying when a person stops being bald and what that shows in this case is that there seem to be some notions and concepts that are what we will call vague. They are fussy. We can't really fully determine them, right, and there's a sample of them like for instance a heap of grain, right. If we have a heap of grain let's say 10,000 grains I take away one grain it's still a heap. I take another one still a heap. Grain doesn't seem to make a difference, but if I take away so many that I'm only left with one grain there's no heap any longer. Is there an exact moment where I can say it's not a heap any longer? Probably not. Philosophers have called this kind of concept vagueness concepts and there's lots of work done because it's also in some sense vague where the vagueness starts, right. I can see it's intriguing and it's a lot of fun, but are you well-discovered on this program for the last goodness knows how many years that the things that seem very odd and eccentric and rather miraculous certainly turn out to be running the world, don't they, these ideas? Okay, so in this case I think with paradoxes there's two reasons why they are actually very fruitful for philosophers, right. It sounds ironic because in some sense with a paradox you're at a dead end and you could say well okay now should we not give up, but they are very fruitful for philosophy for two reasons. Either because they show there's something funny about some concepts like Mr. Bald Man, right. They show we are using some concepts that can't be fully determined in the way other concepts can and that tells us perhaps something either about our concepts or perhaps even about the world that some parts of the world are best described like this, right. Then paradoxes can also be fruitful in one other way namely that in philosophy a lot of what we do is actually done conceptually, right. So our theories and models and concepts very often not just falsified or verified by the world outside, right. So how do we figure out whether our models are right or not? Well paradoxes are very important because they tell us okay something has gone wrong here. You have to go back at your concept and look again whether your assumptions are really as good and true as you thought they are. Marcus Usootoy, that time you've written or you've said mathematicians mathematics as an analytical subject was beginning to emerge. Mathematics were exploring abstract ideas through mathematics. Now would that be cannot be your starting point for talking about paradoxes? Yes certainly. I think that before the ancient Greeks got their teeth into the subject you've got the Egyptians and Babylonians doing a mathematics trying to describe the world with this new language but it's very geometric, it's very functional, they're measuring areas of land, volumes of pyramids and things like that but then the ancient Greeks and in particular sort of in the 100 years before Zeno we have the Pythagoreans beginning to appear on the scene and they're trying to prove things. So they're trying to prove that it's not just a calculation that they want to do, they want to produce a proof that something will always work. So for example... Where did that come from? Well I think it's interesting because I think that the Egyptian and Babylonian mathematics came from the development of the city trying to actually control the land but this idea of analytic thought actually comes from Greeks actually wanting to do politics and it comes out of the idea of rhetoric and trying to explain... How does that work? Well I think that you've got suddenly the Greeks trying to prove that laws will work and that laws will always apply and so I think it sort of grows out of that sort of change of the city into a political institution and so I think the ancient Greeks you see a different style of mathematics and what I would really call mathematics this idea of analytic thinking but it's interesting that you know the idea of paradox is starting to appear at this time perhaps a little bit after Zeno as a tool which is this idea of a proof reductio ad absurdum. Make a hypothesis for example that the square root of two can be written as a fraction and then you follow that through and you end up with a ridiculous conclusion that odd numbers equal even numbers and then you realise that that's absurd it's a kind of paradox but the paradox is very useful because you can then work backwards and say okay something along the way was wrong and it was actually the Pythagoreans who discovered no this square root of two which is a length it's the length across the diagonal of a square each side has unit length so this length cannot be written as a fraction it can be approximated by fractions more and more but they realised using this argument that there were new numbers here so the idea of paradox or this idea of teasing out a logical argument which arrives at something absurd is a very powerful tool in actually questioning your assumptions one of the things a metaphysical thing that the Greeks turned into mathematics was the idea of infinity and we'd say problems with how do they tackle that well they did have problems with infinity and a lot of their mathematics you can see is is very finite it's very geometric it's about lengths and this discovery that the square root of two can't be written as to a ratio of two whole numbers if you write it as an infinite as a decimal it goes on forever never repeating itself was a real challenge to their whole philosophy but in fact you can look back even in the um ancient Egyptians in order to calculate the volume of a pyramid we now know that they must have had some idea of infinitely dividing space so it's not in the documents but the volume the the formula you that you get actually you have to use an idea of infinite divisibility to be able to get that formula is an early form of integral calculus so already these ideas are beginning to sort of bubble up and they're having difficulties with okay but you know infinity doesn't seem to exist i can't see anything infinite so they have this idea of absolute actual infinity and um uh what's the other one potentially thank you there you go uh potential infinity so there's a potential for infinity for example euclid proves that the primes have the potential to go on forever but there's a claim that well this isn't an actual infinity you can't actually have infinitely many primes they have the potential to go on forever so um some of these yes get back to the paradox this is where paradoxes become very useful because it can tease out is it a key key i mean is it really that important the paradox well the paradoxes will be able to to reveal that your ideas of infinity might actually be wrong so that's what he's setting out to do well i think that he's trying to actually support parmenides who isn't bringing him some kind of mathematical perspective on the fact that there is no such thing as motion he's trying to actually use this now actually as a mathematical tool to to question whether our perceptions of the world are actually correct or not so that's the the idea behind it is say let's see what the world is about let's see the reality i mean one sense of play to is to dream and but this is mathematical by a mathematical analysis it's a different reality from that which we perceive and let's challenge parmenides who might have been right anyway but by challenging him we might unlock this is there something in that james warren i think that's right um i think that another thing to bear in mind is that these paradoxes are sort of playful and they would have been a way of xeno embarrassing an interlocutor in the way that you might remember socrates embarrassing people so he takes someone he says well you think things move don't you yes of course i think things move well wouldn't you for example think that you would you would agree wouldn't you that in order to get from a to b you must get halfway from a to b well yes of course i would have to get from halfway from a to b in order to get from a to b well surely you would then agree in order to get from a to halfway to b you would have to get halfway from a to halfway between a to b and so on and so on and here you have another example of uh what we saw in barbara's bald man case this repeating uh premise once you've granted once that in order to get from one point to another you have to go halfway that gets repeated and repeated and repeated this is the dichotomy right exactly so this is what i think sorry i splitted that dichotomy power right which just means cutting in two dichotomy and uh that label gets associated with more than one paradox in the sources but aristotle i think associates it with a paradox of motion in the way that i've been trying to set out so in order to uh cross a spatial extension you must go halfway but then of course you must go halfway to the halfway and so on and so on but by saying that what is he saying that's that's what's going to prove what's problematic paradox what's problematic then is that you've got your person to agree that in order to cross any spatial extension in fact that entails an endless series of prior journeys if you like so in order to do something first i have to do something prior and if that's an endless series of prior requirements before i even get started then you can the the killer line will say but you don't think you can complete an infinite series of tasks can you it would it would be impossible to do an infinite series of journeys well i suppose that's true um and there's obviously a sense in which that is true in which case it now looks like in order to cross a room that's asking me to do something impossible aristotle rose up against these paradoxes again and again didn't he it becomes like a sort of heavyweight championship at one stage zena says this and aristotle ways in biff what did he biff about on this one well on this one he he thinks um as we've just it's it's aristotle's distinction between potential and actual infinity he thinks it's misdescribing the job to say that you have to complete an actual series of infinite journeys potentially if you wanted you could you could think of your journeys including however many sub journeys that you like but you don't actually have to do all of those in order to cross the room but aristotle's working from the assumption that of course zeno must be wrong because of course things do move and there are many things so he he's of the opinion that the absurdity of the conclusion licenses you to think there must be something wrong with the argument and he can just move on and carry on writing his book on physics but the argument goes on that's interesting thing isn't it great as aristotle is and so on so he doesn't kill it i mean it continues it emerges it reemerges and barbara sattler probably the best known paradox is achilles and the tortoise uh can you tell us what's happening there sure what zeno says is happening there right um so achilles and the tortoise is basically a variation of the dichotomy paradox that we have just heard from james so imagine that achilles who is the fastest runner in the ancient world has a race with the slowest runner in the ancient world a tortoise as its later tradition calls it and because achilles is the fastest runner he can give the tortoise a head start right so let's imagine they are racing on a 100 meter uh racetrack and the tortoise is starting 10 meters in so what now has to happen is that first achilles has to cover these 10 meters that the tortoise was given as a head start but during the time that achilles takes in order to cover this 10 meters well the tortoise will have moved on not very far because it's very slow but let's say the tortoise moved on for a meter well next thing that achilles has to do is to cover this one meter during that time while he's covering this one meter the tortoise will have moved on yet again let's say 10 centimeters um again you know the same happens so the distance between achilles and the tortoise will get less and less but will never get to zero so it seems that achilles even though he's the fastest runner in the ancient world will never be able to overtake the slow tortoise right so that's the uh paradox did uh i mean like i said this once before and i'll never say it again after this did common sense wear its head um so common sense uh if you wanted read its head in that some people thought oh okay we can just contradict seno by getting up and running and showing that you know we can overtake somebody right but i don't think that seno wanted to show we will never experience somebody overtaking somebody else right or somebody covering a finite distance rather what he's telling us is okay and you give me an explanation of how this happens you give me an account you describe what is going on and you will get into contradictions right so even though we experience it we can't give a good explanation of it i think i think the the paradox is more interesting than common sense actually and obviously it leads to more things don't you think well it's as you said before it pops up over and over again so that shows that people have thought okay there's something still going on some something in this paradox shows that if we try to explain motion uh change time and space there are still problems that we get into and that get us into these contradictions and that seno for the first time race picture this you're standing on the beach when you notice something strange the horizon doesn't look right at first all you can see is a thin white line stretching as far as your eyes can see then the line starts to rise you squint thinking maybe it's a trick of the light but it's not the horizon at all it's a wave a 30-foot wall of water and it's racing straight toward you what would you do listen to against the odds tsunami in thailand wherever you get your podcasts so can you unpick that more can we go into this why is this fascinating and why does it continue beside sort of rather brutally said what about common sense of course i mean boringly said that but what is interesting is that the idea goes on what is interesting is that the idea is a powerful idea and still is still employed in various ways and today so can you just let's go into that what's going on well this really the challenge of the infinite and in particular uh something called an infinite series because we're having to add up infinitely many things and understand whether that's actually sort of physically possible so the the way mathematicians eventually resolve this is to say well okay how long does it take um achilles to do this infinite number of tasks so let's say he does the the first step in half a minute the second step he does in half the time so quarter of a minute the third step in an eighth of a minute the next step in a sixteenth of a minute so it looks like he's having to do infinitely many tasks but the we understand this now that he can do infinitely many tasks because it can take him a finite amount of time this infinite series a half plus a quarter plus an eighth plus a sixteenth actually adds up if you do take infinitely many of them to the answer one and you can sort of see that if you imagine a cake and you cut the cake in half and then you cut the the half in a quarter and then an eighth and then a sixteenth you can see that you'll be cutting each of the smaller pieces in half again but it won't be any more than one so we know that this infinitely many tasks will take a finite amount of time and it's interesting maybe takes less than a minute so mathematicians had to come up with some sort of way of understanding adding up infinitely many things and it doesn't mean that adding up anything will always work for example take the add a half plus a third plus a quarter plus a fifth plus a sixth plus a seventh plus an eighth you might say well those are getting very very small maybe that adds up to something finite but Orame in the 14th century proved that actually no that can become as large as you want so Zeno is already challenging us with how do you understand how to do add up infinitely many things in mathematics and and does that have some sort of physical reality and it really took till 17th 18th century for mathematicians to come up with some way to understand how to navigate these infinitely many numbers and add them up and understand when they are a finite and when they could be infinite what's fascinating to me a non-mathematician and i'll go back to you for a moment Barbara if i mean is why how what grabbed people mathematicians about this why was this so important to keep studying this which was i think you use have used the word not me this time in your notes patently ridiculous but away they go what is so fascinating about it so one thing that's so fascinating about it is that it seems in the physical reality we don't have a problem with these things right we can do this run our killers can overtake the tortures no problem but yet in mathematics which we use in order to describe the physical reality there seem to be a real problem with this dealing with infinity right so our most powerful tool to describe the reality and to deal with it which we use in natural science all the time right that seemed to be too too weak to deal with that that seemed to get us into contradictions and if you have a contradiction then you know you have a trouble with your science it's not a solid scientific if there's a contradiction at heart right so that's why mathematicians were really fighting with that and saying okay if we don't want a contradiction at the very basis of our science right and and then in the 17th and 18th century as marcus said there was a new way of dealing with well infinite series then with cauchy we have the dealing with limits we have in the 19th century a new way of dealing with actual infinity remember with aristotle we had this distinction between potential and actual infinity and there was always this idea there can't be actual infinity there can only be potential and then with canto and others we had this idea no there can be an actual infinity and that just needs a different way of dealing with it that goes against our intuitions by the way James Warren it seems to me that mathematics is being used in a philosophical way all the way here that the idea is still let's go back to parmenides saying bluntly the world does not move nothing moves it is one thing it is not many things as you natural philosophers have been thinking for the last few centuries it doesn't change all the time it doesn't move on it is one thing that is that what i proposed like a previous person said it's all water uh he'd done that and so we're into the fact that it sort of has a comic aspect as as mathematical things right is only is a superficial reading of it because they the mathematicians are going for something else aren't they i think one one of the things that that might emerge from talking about these um paradoxes is in a mathematical way is the relationship that mathematical analysis has to these kinds of physical cases um so the question whether in fact mathematics is an abstracted description of what's going on or that somehow um we can construct physical extensions and so on out of mathematical items is is is worth um thinking about so for example um one of the one of the things um Aristotle complains about is that um one of these problems that Zeno raises is is is driven by the idea that somehow an extension just is an infinite connection of points and he says well that's just not the case you can't make a line out of points any more than you can construct a duration out of instance what what a mathematical point does is is an abstracted um uh what you're doing is taking an extension that's already there and picking out something out of it you you're not constructing the world mathematically so let's let's look at that notion with regard to the arrow right flight or the arrow at rest but many of these argued and and Zeno puts it forward that the arrow never moves so somebody shoots an arrow it never moves what's going on there right so the absurd conclusion here is that the moving arrow is always at rest and the reconstruction that we get of it from Aristotle goes something like this that um if you imagine an arrow that's being loosed from a bow heading towards a target um if you think of any point in the arrow's journey uh by point i mean now an instant a temporal point so imagine taking a photograph of it that captures uh an an instant in that flight at that point the arrow is occupying a space exactly arrow shaped and arrow sized and it's not moving within that space it's stationary at that at that instant um you can think of it that either it's too snugly held by space or there's not enough time for it to do any moving because the we've we've we've um we've uh specified that we're talking about an instant so a durationless um point in time but that's the case throughout the arrow's journey you could you could pick any instant in the arrow's journey and it would always be the case that at that instant the arrow is stationary so it seems to be true throughout the journey that the arrow is not moving and Aristotle said well Aristotle says this is false because time a duration is not made of nows yes a duration can have a sensuous can we keep on the arrow because it's such a graphic one people listening you have the arrow Frederick of the arrow and it is doesn't seem to be moving except for that instant but even that instant is an instant is it not moving fractionally very fractionally are we not seeing it between two so fractional movements that we can't see the movements or are we seeing it does that rest what does that rest mean well i think it's the challenge of um this arrow is um a changing speed it's um decelerating as it goes towards so it's got a different speed at every particular time and it was the real challenge of actually uh for it to be moving it has to have a speed and if you just take um an instant of time the time interval is zero and well the distance it's gone is zero but speed is distance divided by time so you're trying to make sense of well it doesn't have a speed then does it zero divide distance divided by zero time but you're absolutely right in the the the way you try to approach that problem because and you've just invented the calculus melvin um because what um newton lineless did is to realize that actually um this thing does have a speed but you've got to understand it as the time interval that you're taking gets smaller and smaller and smaller so um if you take a um the time interval of one second before the snapshot you've done then you've got an average speed the distance it's gone over that one second divided by the one second now take the time interval a little bit smaller and you get an another average speed but it's slightly slower for the half second before then and the quarter second so you see though that the speed um is actually tending towards a limit and calculus is making sense of this challenge that zeno has said well what is the speed it's it's zero divided by zero it doesn't have a speed that's meaningless it isn't moving newton and leibniz say no we have a mathematics now developed uh in by my newton and leibniz so to actually understand a world in flux and be able to say at one instance of time what the speed of the arrow is james one i don't think zeno would be impressed by that really i think that's mathematically clever but philosophically not so smart because because you've cheated you you've assumed the arrow is moving um and then have described how it can be moving at a time at an instant on the assumption that it is crossing some distance and that's precisely what's at question you can't help yourself to the conclusion that you're trying to get and his second point will be well surely you would agree then that if if we can allow ourselves that now is can be described as an instant uh it's true that the arrow isn't moving now and if it isn't moving now when when on earth is it moving well i would say that moving means it has a speed and newton and leibniz have given you a way to say what the speed of that is yeah oh my gosh they're ganging up against both of you you think of the bridge and the man defending they're all rushing at him he defends the bridge it's a point of marcus so um philosophers afterwards try to actually um think of motion really in that way so with russell and others we have this idea of the ad ad theory of motion as it's called so that motion is nothing but being at a particular point at a particular time right and the difference between motion and rest is just that you look at the surrounding right and if you look at the surrounding then something in motion will be at a different uh point in space at the next moment of time and something at rest will still be at the same point so that has been a famous theory at ad theory but i would gang up you know help james here saying this is a very useful way in mathematics to describe motion right and we have come to use it and employed all the time doesn't tell us that motion consists of these points right it tells us we can describe motion in this way in this mathematical way it's very useful to do that but it doesn't tell us that we really have understood what's going on with motion in this sense well it's interesting because actually there's a a modern day effect in quantum physics which actually says that it uh that motion sort of doesn't happen it's called the quantum zeno effect which is um quantum physics says two electrons can be uh sort of it's uh two places at the same time but when you observe them um so it could be here and there but when i observe it has to make up its mind where it is so it's there um but then as if i don't look it starts to evolve again but if i look very quickly it's mostly there and so it collapses back into the their state so actually um this is a kind called the zeno uh quantum effect because if i keep on looking at it actually i can stop this thing evolving so i've actually bought a pot of uranium into the studio um which is the same effect if i keep on observing this i can actually stop it radiating because it can never has a chance to move um because of my observations that's like magic i mean i mean i'm fascinated by all this stuff and i'm fascinated by magic so there you are hands off so you look at it and it stops moving now what's going on are you are you the only one can i look at it as long as someone's looking i mean this is the challenge of quantum physics and but it's actually been done in experiments so touring was the first to come up with alan touring the mathematician to with you know potentially this is the the consequences of this i mean actually anyone who's a doctor who fan will know that this is the key to the weeping angels which provided you keep on looking at them are these statues which don't move but you look away and then they start moving so so in a way xeno is saying you know i'm looking at this thing it's not moving but if i look away maybe it's the arrow comes towards me where's xeno in all this fambra um well i mean xeno reemerges with this paradox so people again have jumped on you know the name xeno because they think there's something similar going on a similar motivation but i think what that brings up this example that marcus just gave is that we have to ask whether on the quantum level motion works in the very same way as it does on you know the bigger level so to say when we move right when we move we think we can talk about continuous motion and there the question is well couldn't it how do we really explain them getting from one point to the next right isn't there more to motion but on the quantum level it seems that there is this discontinuous jumps if you want right so motion may work completely different on this level james you want to come here yeah i just wanted to to point out that there's a there was an ancient set of you know quantum theorists who did indeed react to xeno in an interesting way so in in you can tell a reasonable and plausible story that says ancient atomist theory emerged as a response to xenonian paradoxes this is in the fourth century yeah towards the end of the fifth and and going forward and so because what they do when they're faced with the paradoxes as we've set them out is they deny the premise that division can carry on endlessly that they say there isn't in fact an endless series of journeys that i need to make across the room there's a very large number of them but eventually you'll get to a point where you can't divide any further and you have an indivisible but extended space which you can't cross only a half of so once you get going then then xeno's conclusion doesn't follow i mean one thing that shows i think is that xenos paradoxes were extremely fruitful because they sparked the following natural philosophers to come up with some solutions so the atomic solution to say well there are indivisible minima and we can't go on dividing infinitely is one aristotle is another all natural philosophers after xeno in some way or other had to find a way to deal with them if they wanted to do natural philosophy did was is it can you see an over arcing system over arcing system in xenos paradoxes i mean parmenides and simple over arcing system nothing moves right let's keep him in mind because he's the starting point xeno by defending uh parmenides his tutor and his friend posited the opposite and then tried to destroy the opposite that was his method of doing what i think the way to put it is that what the paradoxes show is that um the assumption that there are many things and that things move is no less um fraught with difficulty and no less absurd than thinking that there's only one thing and it doesn't move um so it's difficult to assert a kind of systematic approach to the paradoxes we have a set of them that seem to deny motion on various counts there are some that seem to be attacking the bare notion of plurality in various ways um and i think it would be hard to think that there was some some kind of overarching point to them and that's in in a way why they're kind of fruitful because um he he isn't take he isn't offering a particular world view i think what he's doing is raising problems for a very very general set of assumptions you don't need to be a aristotle to be bothered by xeno you don't need to have a very specific physical outlook to be bothered by xeno the premises that he starts with are extremely general and very common is there any way in which uh we can start to characterize how these ideas are in play now marcus very much so we've talked about leibniz and newton being exercised by them verton russell was with his set of sets and so on and so forth but you you talk in your notes about how these are in play now at a very deep level of i think the idea of a paradox is is still very much used today to tease out um and challenge our view of reality um certainly when we're getting down onto the quantum level or the cosmic level uh our intuition is generally quite wrong and and the idea of paradox is is quite important in just saying look there's still something to sort out here um and i think you know xeno we've we talked about um quantum physics and the fact that actually the universe may be made out of bits there may be a shortest distance that um you can go and you can't divide that quantum means bitty and even time there is a challenge now that time is quantized and comes in bits um and and so i think the this idea of um i mean infinitely many tasks that was what the kind of challenge at the heart of trying to overtake the tortoise is to do infinitely many things and there have been sort of more recent challenges okay is that physically possible in our universe actually is our universe as the ancient pythagoreans thought very finite in its nature and and made up of you know doesn't have uh sort of infinite decimals in its kind of makeup and so they're in these new challenges called super tasks um can you switch on a light off on and off on and off and half the time between you're switching the light on and off and if you do that in in one minute um is the light on or off at the end of this and and it doesn't seem to make a sense so sort of challenges can you do infinitely many sort of uh discrete actions i guess the point about achilles is that it's a continuous and you can join them up but if you have these discrete things of switching a light on after half a minute off after a quarter of a minute on after an eighth of a minute off after a 16th a minute um you can you is that actually ever physically going to be possible and what is the end result at uh the when you add all of these up at that minute whether is the light on or off uh so these paradoxes are still very um relevant today in teasing out just the nature of reality and and our our intuition about it before we leave this it might be i'd like to sort of tip about palmenides who as you were kicked he's as briefly has his idea of the world not moving got any traction at all um there are some people in philosophy who have now gone back to some form of monism right who say well um at the deep level of reality there is just one thing some people think it is um just a question of dependence so everything depends on you know there being one thing namely the universe and other people think no it's just in general there's just one thing um it sounds funny and monism i think is not something that is immediately um very attractive to the common sense but some philosophers um in john shaffer michael de la roca and so on uh contemporary philosophers have gone back to that and said okay metaphysically it does make sense to say at the ultimate level there is only one thing even though it contains so to say everything what does it mean one thing one source of energy one type of energy is that what we mean well i mean one of the problems we haven't addressed is what's the thing okay that's a very good question what is a thing right um so it's also not clear that was palminides whether he really thought about the universe or whether he wouldn't think about something that's completely non-physical right for him it was very important that we don't get into contradictions so the only thing that we can think of is just one thing something that has no differences uh no distinctions no extension that doesn't quite sound physical to us right so for him it seemed to be something logical do you want to add to that james no no no i i think i think barbara's captured that rather well that um uh there's a there is an attraction to monism in the sense that um it would be nice to be to be able to find a simple explanation simplicity is something that um natural scientists look for and what could be more simple than there really only being one thing at all that sounds like a perfect end result and finally marcus well i think mathematicians think they've sorted these paradoxes out and the invention of infinite series and the calculus gives us a way to explain them but i think actually there's still the challenge of with mathematics is really describing reality thank you very much i enjoyed that nice to be back barbara's hatler marcus is so toy james one thank you very much next week it's four legs good two legs bad yes we'll be talking about animal farm by george and the in our time podcast gets some extra time now with a few minutes of bonus material from melvin and his guests what did we not talk about that we should have talked about well there are those there are the paradoxes of plurality that we we didn't discuss and but they were they were sort of in the offing uh when you're asking barbara what a thing is um exactly that's why i thought should i not jump on but you wanted to talk about so and and those are very peculiar they ask the question basically um what makes one thing one thing right and how can we be sure that these two things here for instance are two different things well because there's another thing in between just air okay but how can i be sure that air is different from that one and it's they are in some sense less attractive but they have raised this important question what makes a thing a thing yeah i think it also relates to the tension that was raised about how how can points infinitely many points make a line because the point has no distance so if you add something which has zero distance to something which has zero distance it's still got zero distance yeah and that was the real challenge of and you mentioned cantor i'm glad you got that in because cantor around that time you're understanding the idea of the continuum there are different sorts of infinities so actually if you take an uncountable number of points it can have measure right the idea that um infinitely many points with no size can actually be put together to make something with size i mean and that was a real challenge of 19th century mathematics to come up with a way of understanding that ability to measure and make you know a ruler is made up of distances square root of two pi and something like that but these numbers have no distance it's really like the arrow zeno's arrow so how can you have all of these numbers actually make up a line a ruler that's i think very similar to um uh zeno's millet seed paradox right which is different again from the how many grains make a heap paradox but it's it's saying well if i drop a single seed it doesn't make a noise well i think it does you see i just we can't hear it that's all and maybe an ant can hear it there goes a millet seed i'll pop across but there's a difference between it disturbing the disturbing the air and it making a noise but it's clear that a large number of minutes can i rest can i rest on mine for a moment i know i've gone completely but still if it drops in my view it'll make a sound and the sound can be heard by those with ears to hear okay maybe an ant that may be what he's been waiting since you work up this is breakfast this is the military so half a millet seed then or half of the interesting thing is you're getting to quantum physics now but this is what einstein won his noble prize for essentially is to understand that um uh there are actually thresholds below which you cannot activate things um and so this idea of infinitely dividing something was a real challenge the quantum world says no well you can't just keep on lowering the amplitude of a sound wave at some point it flatlines and there's a gap and that quantum gap it's it's the plank constant so i think that that's why all of these paradoxes are really still very relevant today i mean it's this vagueness paradoxes that we talked about in the beginning about the boldness and the heap of grains and in some sense it also falls in there saying can we specify you know from three grains onwards we can hear it or not and then quantum physics tells us yeah we can um in but in in in with many other concepts it seems just arbitrary to say you know okay from five hair onwards i was interested you choose chose that as a paradox actually because i thought you were going to as soon as you mentioned here i thought you were going to go for something like the barber right um the barber who only shapes those don't shave themselves which leaves you realize that that's but i i'm glad you didn't choose that because i feel that's just a paradox of language in the sense that this thing cannot exist right i suppose that that's the point you're trying to show that there can't be a barber who only shaves those who don't shave themselves the paradox is the barber yeah paradox is resolved by saying this person does not exist your hypothesis there is such a thing so i think yeah you know there's a reductor ad absurdum and i think the important thing was there's kind of two different ways in which paradoxes the producer comes to make the most announcement sorry to interrupt who'd like tea or okay oh this will run and run in our time with melvin brag is produced by me simon tillotson and it's a
